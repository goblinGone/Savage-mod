-Endive's Self Sufficiency Mod v0.20-The purpose of this mod is to allow a player to more reasonable run off into the woods, and live the life of a hermit! What does this mean? I have added an assortment of items and included other mods which allow the player to attain certain items without the need to visit villages or trade. Many of the items are simply those which have largely been uncraftable,  and could only be acquired through trading, however the items should still be reasonably/realistically difficult to make!  Though I hope to limit the items to their basic types, and leave out Cultural Weapons/tools (Northern Knife, Northern Bow, etc.)This mod includes many of my own recipes, Rain's Cloth Mod, Rain's IronWorking Mod, "thefinn"'s dugout canoe mod, and other ideas/ bits and pieces from the forums!FEATURES:   + Well    allows the player to dig a well to create a source of water for their homestead (adopted from Sami's recipe!)      +Dugout Canoe (punt) 	by 'thefinn" from the modding forums ( I changed some of the crafting times)    +Crafting Nets and Fishing Rods	    +Primitive Cord    Made by soaking branches in water to soften the bark, then using the fibers to weave cord (technically not all the branches are best for this,     but cant do much to customize this, in the future I will add other plants that are known to be good for cordage,milkweed, for example)    +Added Stone Knife, Stone Spear    Stone Knife is crafted without the need for any other tools, and allows the player to continue on if they lose a knife    +Longbow    this is a long 6 step process , felltree->treetrunk->log->bow stave->shaped bow stave->unfinished longbow->longbow    +Rainscloth Mod v2    Adds many options for making your own clothing!    +RainsIron Mod v.91    Allows for player to create their own iron tools, weapons, armor.    **added Broad,Carving, and Splitting axes,'Iron hoop', Roundshield, Buckler, and Wooden Tub recipes	**reorganized armors into new subcatefory	+Sauna Scoop!*Will add more content in the future, just whatever makes sense!*How to Install:1.
